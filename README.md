The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my ability to implement highly scalable web applications build
using the two prominent architectural styles (MVC and RESTful web services). The RESTful web
service will serve data in three formats (JSON, XML and Text) which will then be consumed by a
JS client application that will facilitate full CRUD functionality on the database.

Learning outcomes being assessed:
1. Create highly scalable software solutions using contemporary cloud computing services and tools.
2. Critically evaluate the competing cloud providers, selecting an appropriate provider for a
specific problem, system or use case.
3. Create and critically review distributed applications in a suitable language.
4. Apply knowledge of web services technology to create distributed systems.
5. Critically analyse and implement Design Patterns in appropriate programming contexts.

Due to university guidelines on academic dishonesty I can't provide the raw code but will demonstrate my learning
throughout screenshots and write ups.
