# Microservices

For this project there are two microservices, the BookController which serves the book CRUD functionality, and the GenreController to serve the genre features. I
chose to serve the genre as a microservice to reduce the computational load that would be required to process the genre algorithms on the client server, improving
user experience. The BookController is served at the endpoint “/api/v1/books” and it accepts HTTP request of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Part of the assignment was to implement the CRUD operation using Json, XML and a custom Text format.

## HTTP GET

## HTTP POST

## HTTP PUT

## HTTP DELETE
