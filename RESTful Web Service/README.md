The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style allows a websites data and functionality to be accssesed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs),
such as a typical web address followed by parameters. The REST architectural style allows complete seperation of the client and server archtectures which communicate
via a stateless protocol such as HTTP.
However, these can introduce increased design complexity, reliance on web connectivity and
can be less flexable that other API methods due the REST achitecture principles.

In this repo I will showcase the microservices that I implemented and connections to the database.
