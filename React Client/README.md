## React.js Client-Side

For the client-side portion of the project, there were several options to choose from.
Frontend rendering can be achieved with just HTML and CSS, the addition of
JavaScript (JS) adds a new dimension of interactivity. With numerous libraries and
frameworks available, I’ve opted to use Vite, a React framework, rather than purely
AJAX and jQuery, due to is powerful features but fewer configurations than other
React frameworks. Vite has options to use the TypeScript language, which is more
robust, but I’ve stuck with JS due to time commitments during this project; however, I intend to
learn TypeScript for future projects.

To showcase my work, I've included code snippets of the CRUD Operations which rely on HTTP GET, POST, PUT & DELETE APIs 
served by the Java REST API microservices. I've included a code extract for the edit view functionality (EditView.jsx).
I have also included some of the design patterns, best practiceses and features I enjoyed building.
