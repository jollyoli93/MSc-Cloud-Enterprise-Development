# React Design Patterns and Best Practices

Showcasing some design patterns I implemented in the client application

## Container and Presentational Pattern
One of the most popular patterns
used in React, itâ€™s used to separate the logic from the user interface. In the case of the app.js file, the app container sets the state and manages logic and calls 
upon the presentational components, such as the footer and header

## Context API

Allows globally accessible variables across the application without having to pass the data as props.

## Hook Pattern
Not officially a design pattern, but replaces many other patterns (Such as Container-Presenter), it is used to manage state and sideeffects of functional components

## Atomic Design
Throughout this React project, I implemented and made use of the Atomic Design Principles by Brad Frost, inspired by principles of chemistry. Which I find really helps me keep a structured organisation of my React components.
