# Views

The views are vital for the frontend application to allow users to interact with the website. The views are all served by their respective controllers, which handle the data from the database. I have  roughly 10 views in this project, which are used to display the data, success pages and also login/logout functionality. 

The views are written in JSTL and EL - JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library, and Expression Language. This is a simple and powerful combination to manipulate and control the data coming from the controllers.
